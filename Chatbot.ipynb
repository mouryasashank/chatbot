waste from the blood and maintains the body's normal chemical balance.\", 'With polycystic kidney disease (right), fluid-filled sacs called cysts develop in the kidneys, causing them to grow larger and gradually lose their ability to function normally.', 'Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years.', \"Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include:\\n\\nType 1 or type 2 diabetes\\n\\nHigh blood pressure\\n\\nGlomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's filtering units (glomeruli)\\n\\nInterstitial nephritis (in-tur-STISH-ul nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures\\n\\nPolycystic kidney disease\\n\\nProlonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged prostate, kidney stones and some cancers\\n\\nVesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys\\n\\nRecurrent kidney infection, also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRY-tis)\\n\\nRisk factors\\n\\nFactors that may increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include:\\n\\nDiabetes\\n\\nHigh blood pressure\\n\\nHeart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease\\n\\nSmoking\\n\\nObesity\\n\\nBeing African-American, Native American or Asian-American\\n\\nFamily history of kidney disease\\n\\nAbnormal kidney structure\\n\\nOlder age\\n\\nComplications\\n\\nChronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body.\", \"Potential complications may include:\\n\\nFluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema)\\n\\nA sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart's ability to function and may be life-threatening\\n\\nHeart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease\\n\\nWeak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures\\n\\nAnemia\\n\\nDecreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility\\n\\nDamage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures\\n\\nDecreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection\\n\\nPericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart (pericardium)\\n\\nPregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus\\n\\nIrreversible damage to your kidneys (end-stage kidney disease), eventually requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nTo reduce your risk of developing kidney disease:\"]\n"
